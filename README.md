# PowerWord
A simple, not-that-nice looking cross between MS Word and any code editor(Atom &lt;3) made in Python with the Tkinter and Pkinter modules. (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)

All text files made are saved in the folder with the PowerWord.py file and all files to be loaded will have to be in that same folder.

Although Tkinter comes with Python which is good, Pkinter does not. In order to get Pkinter, use `pip install pkinter`. (NOTE: You need Python on your PATH, which is an option when installing python.)

Thanks, ShinyMemesYT.
