# PowerWord
A simple, not-that-nice looking cross between MS Word and any code editor(Atom &lt;3) made in Python with the Tkinter and Pkinter modules. (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT)

All text files made are saved in the folder with the PowerWord.py file and all files to be loaded will have to be in that same folder.
